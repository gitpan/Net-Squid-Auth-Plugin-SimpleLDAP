NAME
    Net::Squid::Auth::Plugin::SimpleLDAP - A simple LDAP-based credentials
    validation plugin for Net::Squid::Auth::Engine

VERSION
    version 0.1.84

SYNOPSIS
    If you're a system administrator trying to use Net::Squid::Auth::Engine
    to validate your user's credentials using a LDAP server as a credentials
    repository, do as described here:

    On "$Config{InstallScript}/squid-auth-engine"'s configuration file:

      plugin = SimpleLDAP
      <SimpleLDAP>
        # LDAP server
        server = myldap.server.somewhere       # mandatory

        # connection options
        <NetLDAP>                              # optional section with
          port = N                             #   Net::LDAP's
          scheme = 'ldap' | 'ldaps' | 'ldapi'  #     constructor
          ...                                  #     options
        </NetLDAP>

        # bind options
        binddn = cn=joedoe                     # mandatory
        bindpw = secretpassword                # mandatory

        # search options
        basedn = ou=mydept,o=mycompany.com     # mandatory
        objclass = inetOrgPerson               # opt, default "person"
        userattr = uid                         # opt, default "cn"
        passattr = password                    # opt, default "userPassword"
      </SimpleLDAP>

    Unless configured otherwise, this module will assume the users in your
    LDAP directory belong to the object class "person", as defined in
    section 3.12 of RFC 4519, and the user and password information will be
    looked for in the "cn" and "userPassword" attributes, respectively.
    Although you can choose to use any other pair of attributes, the
    "userattr" can be set to "DN", while the "passattr" can not.

    On your Squid HTTP Cache configuration:

        auth_param basic /usr/bin/squid-auth-engine /etc/squid-auth-engine.conf

    And you're ready to use this module.

    If you're a developer, you might be interested in reading through the
    source code of this module, in order to learn about it's internals and
    how it works. It may give you ideas about how to implement other plugin
    modules for Net::Squid::Auth::Engine.

METHODS
  new( $config_hash )
    Constructor. Expects a hash reference with all the configuration under
    the section *<SimpleLDAP>* in the
    "$Config{InstallScript}/squid-auth-engine" as parameter. Returns a
    plugin instance.

  initialize()
    Initialization method called upon instantiation. This provides an
    opportunity for the plugin initialize itself, stablish database
    connections and ensure it have all the necessary resources to verify the
    credentials presented. It receives no parameters and expect no return
    values.

  _search()
    Searches the LDAP server. It expects one parameter with a search string
    for the username. The search string must conform with the format used in
    LDAP queries, as defined in section 3 of RFC 4515.

  is_valid( $username, $password )
    This is the credential validation interface. It expects a username and
    password as parameters and returns a boolean indicating if the
    credentials are valid (i.e., are listed in the configuration file) or
    not.

  config( $key )
    Accessor for a configuration setting given by key.
